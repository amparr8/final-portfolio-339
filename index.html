        <p> We are two students studying Information Analysis in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. We are studying abroad next semester, January - May 2023 in Barcelona and Madrid. We decided to travel to Spain because of our shared interest in Spainish culture such as food, festivals, historical landmarks, and nightlife. We both have studied the Spanish language since middle school and would love to get more experience speaking the language. Additionally, our families both celebrate Hispanic festivities. We have both traveled to Spain with our families, but we never independenlty lived in a different country. We are very excited to go back to our roots and be immersed in a new culture where we will take advantage of all the new opportunities that Spain will bring. </p>
