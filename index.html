            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p> We are two students studying Information Analysis in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. We are studying abroad next semester, January - May 2023 in Barcelona and Madrid. We decided to travel to Spain because of our shared interest in Spainish culture such as food, festivals, historical landmarks, and nightlife. We both have studied the Spanish language since middle school and would love to get more experience speaking the language. Additionally, our families both celebrate Hispanic festivities. We have both traveled to Spain with our families, but we never independenlty lived in a different country. We are very excited to go back to our roots and be immersed in a new culture where we will take advantage of all the new opportunities that Spain will bring. </p>

I am living in Malasaña, Madrid with three other rooommates. I am most excited be immersed in a new culure and meet new people while in Spain. My family speaks Spanish, and I have taken Spanish classes throughout my life, but I struggle speaking Spanish, however, I can understand almost everything. I want to be able to practice my Spanish speaking skills and to live independently in another country. I am also excited that I will be able to travel easily to other countries in Europe. Within Spain I want to travel to Seville and Costa Brava.</p>
            <h3> Alina</h3>
            <p> I am studying abroad in Barcelona, Spain for my second semester of my junior year. I am very excited and privileged to be able to living in a different country where I will have the opportunity of learning from people that are different from me. I am very excited to be living in the same country as some of my family members and I hope to be able to visit them in Seville. Visiting my family will allow me to get their perspective on what food I have to try in Spain, what places I have to visit, and which events I must attend. I really want to visit the island of Ibiza as well as make a second trip to the Canary Islands.  I can’t way for this experience of a lifetime and to be able to travel and live alone in this new country that I will call home for 4 months. </p>
